# PsychoTower

A versus tower defense game in which one must via for supremacy through the use of towers. 
However, the towers will not only attack your enemies, but your own forces as well!

## Post-Mortem
This project is dead, I got it to a working protype, and decided not to continue with the project.
This is because, I feel that I could make a better game that uses the same concepts, but with a different framework.
I plan to take what I learned in this project and make something else when I find the time.
